**Project Features**

- User authentication
- Full-stack architecture: Flask backend + React frontend
- Three+ client-side routes with React Router
- API integration
- CRUD functionality

**Development Workflow**

Development followed a vertical slice approach: each feature was built end-to-end across the stack before moving on to the next. This ensured:

- Minimal rework between frontend and backend
